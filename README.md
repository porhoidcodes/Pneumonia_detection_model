Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray Images

This repository contains an AI-powered system developed using deep learning techniques to accurately detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The project utilizes TensorFlow/Keras to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for binary classification of normal and pneumonia cases.

Overview

Pneumonia is a respiratory illness that can be potentially life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated promptly. This project aims to assist healthcare professionals in accurate and efficient pneumonia diagnosis by leveraging the power of computer vision and deep learning.

The CNN model is trained on a dataset of chest X-ray images and incorporates various techniques to enhance performance, including data preprocessing, augmentation, and strategies to mitigate class imbalance issues.

Additionally, the project includes a user-friendly Gradio interface that allows users to upload X-ray images and receive predictions from the trained model seamlessly.

Features

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A deep learning model architecture tailored for image classification tasks, implemented using TensorFlow/Keras.
Data Preprocessing: Techniques such as image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation (e.g., flipping, rotation, zooming) to improve model performance.
Class Imbalance Mitigation: Strategies like oversampling, undersampling, and advanced techniques (e.g., focal loss) to address class imbalance in the dataset.
Gradio Interface: A user-friendly web interface built with Gradio, allowing users to upload chest X-ray images and receive pneumonia predictions from the trained model.
