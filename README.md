<h2 id="overview">🌅 Overview</h2>

<p>This repository contains an <strong>AI-powered system</strong> developed using deep learning techniques to accurately detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The project utilizes <strong>TensorFlow/Keras</strong> to build a <strong>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</strong> model for binary classification of normal and pneumonia cases.</p>

<p>Pneumonia is a respiratory illness that can be potentially life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated promptly. This project aims to assist healthcare professionals in accurate and efficient pneumonia diagnosis by leveraging the power of computer vision and deep learning.</p>

<p>The CNN model is trained on a dataset of chest X-ray images and incorporates various techniques to enhance performance, including data preprocessing, augmentation, and strategies to mitigate class imbalance issues.</p>

<p>Additionally, the project includes a user-friendly <
